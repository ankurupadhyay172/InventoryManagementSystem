# 📦 Inventory Management System – Android App

A complete Inventory Management System Android application built using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose** , **MVVM architecture**,  **Dependency Injection**, **JUnit**, and **Mockito**. This app is developed following **Clean Architecture principles**, and it’s designed from the ground up – starting from **requirement gathering to class diagrams to full codebase implementation**.

> 🎯 Ideal for warehouse or retail environments to manage stock, orders, and product categories efficiently.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

This project reflects my ability to:
- Understand and gather **real-world business requirements**
- Translate them into **UML Class Diagrams**
- Write **modular, scalable, and testable code** in Android
- Implement **Clean Code** practices and **SOLID principles**
- Write and maintain **unit tests** using JUnit and Mockito
- Teach and communicate engineering concepts through **YouTube**

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This app is tested using:

- ✅ **JUnit** – For core business logic and use case validation
- ✅ **Mockito** – For mocking repositories and testing ViewModels
- ✅ **Unit tests** – For all critical features (Order Management, Cart, Inventory updates)
- ✅ Test coverage for **controllers, repositories, and ViewModels**

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

- **MVVM + Clean Code (Model-View-ViewModel)**  
- **Hilt DI** for dependency injection  
- **Repository pattern** with clean use cases  
- **ViewModel + LiveData** for state management
